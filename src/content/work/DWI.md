I had the opportunity to contribute to the Drinking Water Inspectorate's (DWI) website transformation project.

My role centered around transferring valuable content from the existing site to the new platform.

Utilizing WordPress and adhering to the high standard guidelines of gov.uk, I worked diligently to ensure a seamless transition. This involved careful content migration, including the restructuring of articles, posts, and multimedia elements, while maintaining the accuracy and integrity of the information presented.

The experience solidified my skills in website migration and demonstrated the importance of meticulous planning and execution in large-scale digital projects.
