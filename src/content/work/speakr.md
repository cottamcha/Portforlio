One of my self-driven initiatives was the creation of Speakr, a personal project designed as a Twitter clone.

This project, built primarily using SolidJS, gave me a hands-on experience in working with this reactive UI library. Additionally, I utilized Vite for an enhanced development experience and optimized build performance.

The web application has a bespoke design, mirroring key functionalities of Twitter, while also demonstrating my unique styling and design skills. Though the project has some yet-to-be-implemented features, it serves as a testament to my ability to conceptualize, design, and initiate a project from the ground up.

This endeavor allowed me to familiarize myself with SolidJS and Vite, ultimately fostering a deeper understanding of frontend development and performance optimization.
